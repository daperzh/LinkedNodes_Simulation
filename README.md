# LinkedNodes_Simulation
This is a JavaScript project to make my C++ projects easier. (god, I hate pointers)

This will help those who need a visual look at how Nodes and Pointers interact together. The functions of the app is very simple.
-To add a Node or a Pointer, just press the buttons on the top left corner.
-To delete a Node or a Pointer, right click on the item and click "delete"
-To change the values in a Node or a Pointer, double click on the desired box and input in the new value.

Arrows will automatically be drawn on the screen based on the values given.

Enjoy!
