# LinkedNodes_Simulation
This is a JavaScript project to make (some) C++ projects easier.<br /><br />

This will help those who need a visual look at how Nodes and Pointers interact together. The functions of the app is very simple.<br />
-To add a Node or a Pointer, just press the buttons on the top left corner.<br />
-To delete a Node or a Pointer, right click on the item and click "delete"<br />
-To change the values in a Node or a Pointer, double click on the desired box and input in the new value.<br /><br />

Arrows will automatically be drawn on the screen based on the values given.<br /><br />

Enjoy!
